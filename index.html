    <p> This survey consists of 4 sets of randomized colorful squares.
         Your goal is to pick the square that catches your attention first/the most. 
         The response shouldn't take too long, don't over think it! 
         The colorful squares you click will be tracked and used for research over Youtube thumbnails.
         It's recommended to take this survey on google fullscreened, BUT you can take it on safari. Just quickly scroll down to see all of the squares!
